# Niccolo Service Site

**Repository generated from uploaded `niccolo_service_site.zip`.**

## About
A static website (service site) built with HTML/CSS/JS.  
This README was auto-generated by ChatGPT after inspecting the repository contents.

## Features
- Static site ready to be hosted (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
- Clean structure for services, assets, and styles.
- Placeholder content â€” update to match your business.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd niccolo_service_site
```

### 2. Serve locally
If the site is pure static (contains `index.html` at root or `public/index.html`):
```bash
# using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

If the project has a `package.json` and a dev server:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Build (if applicable)
If there is a build step (e.g. `npm run build`), run:
```bash
npm run build
# deploy contents of the build/ or dist/ or public/ folder
```

## Deployment
- **GitHub Pages:** Put static files on the `gh-pages` branch or enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings (choose `main` and `/ (root)` if `index.html` is in root).
- **Netlify / Vercel:** Drag & drop the `build` or `public` folder or connect the repo and set the build command (if any).

## How to customize
1. Edit `index.html` and other HTML files to update content.
2. Replace images in `assets/` or `images/`.
3. Modify styles in CSS files (e.g., `styles.css` or `assets/css/`).
4. Update any JavaScript in `js/` or `assets/js/`.
